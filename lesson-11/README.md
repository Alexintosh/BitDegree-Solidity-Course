# Lesson 11 - Inheritance and polymorphism

In classical object-oriented programming **inheritance** refers to a case where subclass uses the structure and behavior of a superclass.

**Polymorphism** refers to changing the behavior of a superclass in the subclass.

The same principles apply to inheritance and polymorphism when developing Ethereum smart contracts and the general inheritance system is very similar to Pythonâ€™s or Java's, especially concerning multiple inheritance.

When a contract inherits from multiple contracts, only a single contract is created on the blockchain, and the code from all the base contracts is copied into the created contract.

## Full example

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.18;

contract Owned {
    address owner;
    function Owned() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
}

// Use "is" to derive from another contract. Derived
// contracts can access all non-private members including
// internal functions and state variables. These cannot be
// accessed externally via `this`, though.
contract Mortal is Owned {
    function kill() {
        if (msg.sender == owner) selfdestruct(owner);
    }
}

// Car has all the functionality of mortal contract which
// in turns holds all functionality for the owner contract
contract Car {
    string make;
    
    function Car(string _make) {
        make = _make;
    }
    
    function getMake() public view returns(string) { return make; }
    function makeNoise() public pure returns(string) { return "VROOOOM!!!"; }
}

contract Thing {
    string color;
    uint cost;
    
    function Thing(string _color, uint _cost) {
        color = _color;
        cost = _cost;
    }
   
    function getColor() public view returns (string) { return color; }
    function getCost() public view returns (uint) { return cost; }
}

contract ToyotaCar is Mortal, Thing, Car {
    // Due to inheritance we inherit all the properties of Mortal, Thing and Car contracts
    function ToyotaCar(string _color, uint _cost) Thing(_color, _cost) Car("Toyota") {}
    
    // We can override Car methods via polymorphism
    function makeNoise() public pure returns(string) { return "HAROOOM!!!"; }
}
```
