# Lesson 11 - Inheritance and polymorphism

In classical object-oriented programming *inheritance* refers to a case where a class inherits fields and methods from its parent class. A subclass can override methods that it inherits. In short, it uses the structure and behavior of a superclass in a subclass.

*Polymorphism* refers to a case where subclasses can define their own unique behaviors and yet share some of the same functionality of the parent class. In short, polymorphism refers to changing the behavior of a superclass in the subclass.

The same principles apply to inheritance and polymorphism when developing Ethereum smart contracts and the general inheritance system is very similar to Pythonâ€™s or Java's, especially concerning multiple inheritance.

When a contract inherits from multiple contracts, only a single contract is created on the blockchain, and the code from all the base contracts is copied into the created contract.
